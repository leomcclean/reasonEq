\subsection{Introduction}

We produce an abstract user-interface layer that wraps
around the proof-state as encapsulated in \texttt{REqState}.
The idea is that these functions are called by all concrete UIs,
either REPL-based or graphical.

There should be no direct link from a concrete UI to \texttt{REqState}.
For now this is a long-term goal.

We can break this abstract user-interface down into two main parts:
the first provides ways to observe the proof-state,
whilst the second supports modifications to that state.
Each of those parts will be further subdivided:
top-level (\texttt{REqState}),
and then lower level (.e.g., \texttt{LiveProofs}).

\subsection{Observing Proof-State (\texttt{REqState})}

The first issue to address here is in what form such observations
should be returned over an abstract interface,
remembering that the caller might be graphical, textual, or something else.
Possibilities range from returning text of some form,
through to actual data-structures.
However return, for example, a \texttt{Term},
requires the concrete UI to also have access to concrete ways to
handle and render terms.
This may not be an optimal `separation of concerns`.
Given that pretty-printing terms will be important, we may want
some form of structured text.
We also need to allow for the fact that the UI may use the observation structure
as a way to get user input for a subsequent modify operation.

In general we propose that observer functions will support
a number of return formats.

\subsection{Modifying Proof-State (\texttt{REqState})}

\subsubsection{Modifying Settings}

\begin{code}
modifySettings :: Monad m => [String] -> REqState -> m REqState
modifySettings [name,value] reqs
  = case changeSettings name value (settings reqs) of
      But msgs  ->  fail $ unlines' msgs

      Nothing  ->  fail ("No theory named '"++thnm++"'.")
      Just _   ->  return ( changed $ currTheory_ thnm reqs)
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Adding a new conjecture}

Easy, so long as we check for name clashes.
\begin{code}
newConjecture :: Monad m => String -> NmdAssertion -> REqState
              -> m REqState
newConjecture thnm nasn reqs
  = case getTheory thnm $ theories reqs of
      Nothing -> fail ("No theory named '"++thnm++"'.")
      Just thry -> do thry' <- newTheoryConj nasn thry
                      return $ changed
                             $ theories__ (replaceTheory' thry') $ reqs
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Assuming Conjectures}

\begin{code}
assumeConjecture :: Monad m => String -> String -> REqState -> m REqState
assumeConjecture thnm whichC reqs
  = case getTheory thnm thys of
      Nothing -> fail ("No theory named '"++thnm++"'.")
      Just thry
        | whichC == "*"
            ->  do thys' <- assumeDepConj thnm thys
                   return $ changed $ theories_ thys' reqs
        | otherwise
            ->  do thry' <- assumeConj whichC thry

  where thys = theories reqs
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Demoting Laws}

demoteLaw thnm whichL reqs
  = case getTheory thnm $ theories reqs of
      Nothing -> fail ("No theory named '"++thnm++"'.")
      Just thry -> do thry' <- lawDemote whichL thry
                      return $ changed
                             $ theories__ (replaceTheory' thry') $ reqs
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Starting a Proof}

This is not a single abstract UI call,
but rather a series of calls, with all but the last
returning various items that need to be used by the concrete UI
to collect arguments for the next call.
\begin{code}
newProof1 :: Monad m => Int -> REqState
          -> m ( NmdAssertion
               , [(String,Sequent)] ) -- named strategy list
newProof1 i reqs
  = case nlookup i' (getCurrConj reqs) of
      Nothing  ->  fail "invalid conjecture number"
      Just nconj@(nm,asn)
        | shadowFree asn
            -> return
                ( nconj
                , availableStrategies (logicsig reqs) thys currTh nconj )
        | otherwise -> fail "shadowed bound-vars. in conjecture"
  where
    i' = if i == 0 then 1 else i
    currTh = currTheory reqs
    getCurrConj reqs = fromJust $ getTheoryConjectures currTh thys
    thys = theories reqs
    thylist = fromJust $ getTheoryDeps currTh thys

newProof2 :: Monad m => NmdAssertion -> [(String,Sequent)] -> Int -> REqState
          -> m LiveProof
newProof2 (nm,asn) strats six reqs
  = case nlookup six strats of
               Nothing   -> fail "Invalid strategy no"
               Just seqnt
                 -> return $ launchProof thylist currTh nm asn seqnt
  where
    currTh = currTheory reqs
    getCurrConj reqs = fromJust $ getTheoryConjectures currTh thys
    thys = theories reqs
    thylist = fromJust $ getTheoryDeps currTh thys
\end{code}

\subsection{Removing Bound Variable ``Shadowing''}

\textbf{Note:}
\textit{
This is now ensured in any Assertion by construction.
We retain it temporarily as a double-check.
}
We need to ensure that all bound variables in a conjecture
are not ``shadowed'' by bound variables nested deeper in,
as this makes matching and proofs-steps
much easier to implement.
For example, in
\[\forall x \bullet ( \dots (\exists x \bullet P) \dots)\]
the first $x$ in the $\forall$ is shadowed, in $P$,
by the second $x$ in the $\exists$.
This should be replaced by:
\[\forall x \bullet ( \dots (\exists y \bullet P[y/x]) \dots).\]
We simply check this is the case,
rather than making it so.
This is because we have no general way at present
of distinguishing substitutable and non-substitutable terms.
\textbf{Note: }
\textsf{We do now, as theories have a \texttt{SubAbilityMap} component}
\begin{code}
shadowFree :: Assertion -> Bool
shadowFree (Assertion t sc) = shadowFree' sc S.empty t

shadowFree' :: SideCond -> VarSet -> Term -> Bool
shadowFree' sc bvs (Cons _ _ _ ts)   =  all (shadowFree' sc bvs) ts
shadowFree' sc bvs (Bnd _ _ vs tm)   =  shadowFree'' sc bvs vs tm
shadowFree' sc bvs (Lam  _ _ vl tm)  =  shadowFree'' sc bvs (S.fromList vl) tm
shadowFree' sc bvs (Cls _ tm)        =  shadowFree' sc bvs tm
shadowFree' sc bvs (Sub _ t s)       =  shadowFree' sc bvs t
                                        && shadowFreeSub sc bvs s
shadowFree' _  _   asn               =  True

shadowFree'' sc bvs vs tm
 | bvs `disjoint` vs  =  shadowFree' sc (bvs `S.union` vs) tm
 | otherwise          =  False

shadowFreeSub sc bvs (Substn es _)
                             =  all (shadowFree' sc bvs) $ map snd $ S.toList es
\end{code}

      [prf]  ->  return prf
      prfs   ->  if 1 <= i && i <= length prfs
                 then return $ prfs!!(i-1)
                 else fail "No such live proof."
\end{code}

        thnm = conjThName liveProof
        cjnm = conjName liveProof
        del = M.delete (thnm,cjnm)
        currTh = currTheory reqs -- should equal thnm !!!
        addProof = addTheoryProof currTh prf
        upgrade = upgradeConj2Law thnm cjnm
\end{code}

\subsection{Displaying Proof-State}

observeProver :: LiveProof -> [String]
observeProver liveProof =
    [ "Proof for " ++ red (widthHack 2 $ conjName liveProof)
    , "\t" ++ green (trTerm 0 trm ++ "  " ++ trSideCond sc)
    , "by " ++ strategy liveProof ]
    ++  (map shLiveStep $ reverse $ stepsSoFar liveProof)

        , "" ]
  where (trm,sc) = unwrapASN $ conjecture liveProof
\end{code}

        i' = if i <= 0 then 1 else i

    in if ok
        then return ( focus_ (tz',seq')

        else fail "At top"

\end{code}

\subsubsection{Switching Consequent Focus}

\begin{code}
moveConsequentFocus :: Monad m => LiveProof -> m LiveProof
moveConsequentFocus liveProof
  = let
      sz = focus liveProof
      (ok,sw',sz') = switchLeftRight sz
    in if ok
        then do asn' <- mkAsn (exitTZ $ fst sz) (conjSC liveProof)
                return ( focus_ sz'
                       $ matches_ []
                       $ stepsSoFar__ ((sw', asn'):)
                         liveProof )
        else fail "Not in consequent"
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Focus into Hypotheses}

\begin{code}
moveFocusToHypothesis :: Monad m => Int -> LiveProof -> m LiveProof
moveFocusToHypothesis i liveProof
  = let
      sz = focus liveProof
      (ok,sw',sz') = seqGoHyp i sz
      (_,seq') = sz'
      hthry' = getHypotheses seq'
      mcs = buildMatchContext (hthry':ante0 seq')

                       $ matches_ []
                       $ stepsSoFar__ ((sw', asn'):)
                         liveProof )
        else fail ("No hypothesis "++show i)
\end{code}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Return Focus from Hypotheses}

\begin{code}
moveFocusFromHypothesis :: Monad m => LiveProof -> m LiveProof
moveFocusFromHypothesis liveProof
  = let

                         liveProof )
        else fail "Not in hypotheses"
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Match Laws against Focus}

First, matching all laws.
\begin{code}
matchFocus :: LogicSig -> Ranking -> LiveProof -> LiveProof -- needs to be monadic
matchFocus theSig ranking liveProof
  = let (tz,_)      =  focus liveProof
        goalt       =  getTZ tz
        scC         =  conjSC liveProof
        ctxts       =  mtchCtxts liveProof
        asn'        =  fromJust $ mkAsn goalt scC -- need to fix
        newMatches  =  matchInContexts theSig ctxts asn'
        rankedM     =  ranking ctxts newMatches
    in matches_ rankedM liveProof
\end{code}

Second, matching a specific law.
\begin{code}
matchFocusAgainst :: Monad m => String -> LogicSig -> LiveProof -> m LiveProof
matchFocusAgainst lawnm theSig liveProof
  = let (tz,_)      =  focus liveProof
        goalt       =  getTZ tz
        scC         =  conjSC liveProof
        ctxts       =  mtchCtxts liveProof
    in do asn' <- mkAsn goalt scC
          case matchLawByName theSig asn' lawnm ctxts of
            Yes []    -> fail ("No matches against focus for '"++lawnm++"'")
            Yes mtchs -> return $ matches_ mtchs liveProof
            But msgs  -> fail $ unlines msgs
\end{code}

Third, a deep dive to apply \texttt{match} so we can get back errors.
\begin{code}
tryFocusAgainst :: String -> [Int] -> LogicSig -> LiveProof
                -> YesBut (Binding,Term,SideCond,SideCond)
tryFocusAgainst lawnm parts theSig liveProof
  = let (tz,_)      =  focus liveProof
        goalt       =  getTZ tz
        scC         =  conjSC liveProof
        ctxts       =  mtchCtxts liveProof
    in do asn' <- mkAsn goalt scC
          tryLawByName theSig asn' lawnm parts ctxts
\end{code}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Apply Match to Focus}

We have a multi-phase approach here:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Return specified match with a list of floating variables used
    (\texttt{applyMatchToFocus1}).
  \item
    Ask the user how to replace floating variables.
  \item
    Re-instantiate the replacement, discharge side-condition,
    and update the focus
    (\texttt{applyMatchToFocus2}).
\end{itemize}

First we find the match and determine which determine what variables
in the replacement are floating,
and return those along with the match.
\begin{code}
applyMatchToFocus1 :: Monad m
                   => Int -> LiveProof
                   -> m ( VarList, VarList, VarList, [Term], Match )
applyMatchToFocus1 i liveProof
  = do  mtch  <- nlookup i $ matches liveProof
        let gvars = mentionedVars (mRepl mtch)
                    `S.union`
                    scGVars (mLawSC mtch)
        let (stdvars,lstvars)        =  partition isStdV $ S.toList gvars
        let stdFloating              =  filter isFloatingGVar stdvars
        let (lstFloating,lstNormal)  =  partition isFloatingGVar lstvars
        let replTerms                =  subTerms $ assnT $ conjecture liveProof
        return (stdFloating, lstFloating, lstNormal, replTerms, mtch)
\end{code}

The user's choice of a term $P$ for each floating $?x$ is used replace those
floating variables by those terms, in the match binding,
the match replacement predicate, and the mapped match side-condition.
We have two calls here,
one for standard variables,
one for list variables.

\begin{code}
applyMatchToFocus2Std :: Monad m => Variable -> Term -> Match -> m Match
applyMatchToFocus2Std v t m
  = do let bind' = patchVarBind v t $ mBind m
       return m{ mBind = bind' }
  -- mBind  ::  Binding    -- resulting binding
  -- mLawSC ::  SideCond   -- law side-condition mapped to goal
  -- mRepl  ::  Term       -- replacement term, instantiated with binding

applyMatchToFocus2Lst :: Monad m => ListVar -> VarList -> Match-> m Match
applyMatchToFocus2Lst lv vl m = return m
  -- mBind  ::  Binding    -- resulting binding
  -- mLawSC ::  SideCond   -- law side-condition mapped to goal
  -- mRepl  ::  Term       -- replacement term, instantiated with binding
\end{code}

Now given the ``float-free'' match,
try to discharge that side-condition.
If succesful, we replace the focus.
\begin{code}
applyMatchToFocus3 :: Monad m
                   => Match -> VarSet -> Binding
                   -> LiveProof -> m LiveProof
applyMatchToFocus3 mtch floating ubind liveProof
  = let cbind = mBind mtch -- `mergeBindings` ubind
        repl = mLawPart mtch
        scL = snd $ mAsn mtch
        scC = conjSC liveProof
        (tz,seq') = focus liveProof
        dpath = fPath liveProof
        conjpart = exitTZ tz
    in do scLasC <- instantiateSC cbind scL
          scD <- scDischarge scC scLasC
          if onlyFreshSC scD
            then do let freshneeded = snd scD

\subsubsection{Law Instantiation}

\textbf{Note: }\textit{In fact, given that any predicate $P$
can be replaced by $P\land\true$, we can in fact do the instantiation
on any such $P$, replacing it by $P\land L_I$,
where $L_I$ is a law instantiatied
using the context of $P$.}
Replacing \textit{true} by a law, with unknown variables
suitably instantiated.

This is not a single abstract UI call,
but rather a series of calls, with all but the last
returning various items that need to be used by the concrete UI
to collect arguments for the next call.

We start by checking that the focus is \true,
and that we can find some laws.
\begin{code}
lawInstantiate1 :: LogicSig -> LiveProof -> [Law]
lawInstantiate1 theSig liveProof
  = let currt = getTZ $ fst $ focus liveProof
        true = theTrue theSig
        rslaws = concat $ map snd3 $ mtchCtxts liveProof
    in if currt /= true then [] else rslaws
\end{code}

We should now get back those laws as well as the selected number.
We now get the law, and return it along with,
all the unknown free variables in the law,
and all the sub-terms of the complete proof goal.
\begin{code}
lawInstantiate2 :: Monad m
                => [Law] -> Int -> LiveProof -> m (Law,[Variable],[Term])
lawInstantiate2 rslaws i liveProof
  = do law@((lnm,asn),lprov) <- nlookup i rslaws
       let (lawt,lsc) = unwrapASN asn
       let (tz,seq') = focus liveProof
       let psc = conjSC liveProof
       let dpath = fPath liveProof
       let vts = concat $ map thd3 $ mtchCtxts liveProof
       let lFreeV = stdVarSetOf $ S.filter (isUnknownGVar vts)
                                $ theFreeVars $ freeVars lawt
       let goalTerms = reverse $ subTerms (exitTZ tz)
       return (law,S.toList lFreeV,goalTerms)
\end{code}

We now get back a pairing of each law unknown free-variable
with one of the goal sub-terms, as well as the chosen law.
This gives us enough to complete the instantiation.
\begin{code}
lawInstantiate3 :: Monad m
                => Law -> [(Variable,Term)] -> LiveProof -> m LiveProof
lawInstantiate3 law@((lnm,(Assertion lawt lsc)),lprov) varTerms liveProof
  = do lbind <- mkBinding emptyBinding varTerms
       let scC = conjSC liveProof
       ilsc <- instantiateSC lbind lsc
       nsc <- mrgSideCond scC ilsc
       ilawt <- instantiate lbind lawt
       let (tz,seq') = focus liveProof
       let dpath = fPath liveProof
       asn' <- mkAsn (exitTZ tz) (conjSC liveProof)
       return ( focus_ (setTZ ilawt tz,seq')
                $ stepsSoFar__
                  ( ( (UseLaw ByInstantiation lnm lbind dpath)
                    , (asn') ) : )
                  liveProof )

mkBinding bind [] = return bind
mkBinding bind ((v,t):rest)

       mkBinding bind' rest

      hypos = laws $ getHypotheses seq'
      currt = exitTZ tz
    in case nlookup i hypos of
        Nothing -> fail ("No such hypothesis: "++show i)
        Just ((_,(Assertion hypt _)),_)
          -> do asn' <- mkAsn (exitTZ tz) (conjSC liveProof)
                return ( focus_ (mkTZ $ PCons True land [hypt,currt],seq')
                       $ matches_ []
                       $ stepsSoFar__ ((CloneH i, asn'):)
